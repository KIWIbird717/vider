  {
    title: 'Is Vider an NFT project?',
    text: 'No, it is a Move2Earn project. The users need to buy initially an NFT to be able to play. Afterwards they can ride and earn VID tokens. In addition, new NFT bikes can be created by crossing 2 existing NFTs.',
  },
  {
    title: 'How does Vider work?',
    text: 'Users need a bike, our installed app on the phone and a purchased NFT bike inside the app. The users will be able to earn VID when they ride their bike. VID can be sold for SUI, USDT or VIK (our governance token) on exchanges and in our app. Moreover, players can burn VID to upgrade or mint new bikes.',
  },
  {
    title: 'What is the total supply for NFTs?',
    text: 'We plan to mint initially 5555 NFTs. We might organize also a second NFT mint in the next quarter (TBA). However, in the app each user will be able to mint a new NFT by crossing two existing ones. So, the supply is purely dependent on the demand of the market.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Can I walk or run and earn VIDs?',

    text: 'Our mint event will take place at the end of Q2. You can get whitelisted and mint NFTs on our website. The NFTs will be available on Sea market place soon after the mint. Alternatively, the NFTs will be available to be bought in our in-app marketplace.',
  },

    text: 'VIK is the governance token of our ecosystem. Players stake VIK to vote on how the companyâ€™s treasure profit is distributed. When users trade, lease, or mint NFT bikes, a percentage of tax is deducted. The Vider treasury receives these taxes.',
  },
  {
    title: 'When is the ICO and the DEX/ Exchange listing?',
